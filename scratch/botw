I kept dying so I never touched it until this past week. \n\nRealizing you could use any weapons like normal I was having fun with it. The first plateau shrine I did was the major test of strength. That shrine amped me up so much! The twist of having the floor reveal another section and that section had multiple floors and rooms had me so stoked for longer dungeons. I was wicked excited to play the rest of the quest. \n\nUnfortunately that was it. All the rest were regular one/two room caverns. Huge disappointment. They were all pretty easy too. Some did stand out, like the one with the advancing wall, the moving blocks on rails, the vertical wind one, and the previously mentioned test of strength. Over all they're easier than the base game. \n\nThese shrines really hit me hard with strong \"proof of concept\" feelings. More so than the regular shrines.

They are all one large room. They make absolutely no sense if you think about them for a second. All the moving parts are randomly put everywhere with no actual rhyme or reason other than \"here's a random puzzle\". Previous Zelda dungeons were at least put together to look somewhat feasible in game, like a tower, or a castle, a tree, or whatever. Those fit those spaces and had logic to them. So I was really dreading this final beast. \n\nBut I actually enjoyed it lol. I think the final beast is the best put together beast in the game. It's a good simple layout, and the moving parts made a lot more sense. It actually seemed like it was a giant machine. The giant fallout door you open was cool too. Thumbs up. \n\nThe boss was pretty cool. All the different patterns were good, turning into a giant was cool. I couldn't get her to care about bananas though, which was disappointing. But oh well. \n\nAnywho, what are your thoughts on this DLC? How wrong are my opinions and what are your favorite and least favorite things? \n\nOh, and I rode the bike from the plateau to Hateno village and fell in love with it on the way lol","author_fullname":"t2_d2dg2o0w","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"My thoughts on Champions Ballad (Spoilers)","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Spoiler"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/botw","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_z70687","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":0.75,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":2,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Spoiler","can_mod_post":false,"score":2,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1669651173,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.botw","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I always knew you get the bike as a reward for the Ballad, so I never bothered to do it.

I happened to also be finishing up the photo quest so all the added story in the dlc really fleshed everything out. </p>\n\n<p>A big problem I personally have with BotW is I think the divine beasts really suck. They are all one large room. They make absolutely no sense if you think about them for a second. All the moving parts are randomly put everywhere with no actual rhyme or reason other than &quot;here&#39;s a random puzzle&quot;. Previous Zelda dungeons were at least put together to look somewhat feasible in game, like a tower, or a castle, a tree, or whatever. Those fit those spaces and had logic to them. So I was really dreading this final beast. </p>\n\n<p>But I actually enjoyed it lol. I think the final beast is the best put together beast in the game. It&#39;s a good simple layout, and the moving parts made a lot more sense. It actually seemed like it was a giant machine. The giant fallout door you open was cool too. Thumbs up. </p>\n\n<p>The boss was pretty cool. All the different patterns were good, turning into a giant was cool. I couldn&#39;t get her to care about bananas though, which was disappointing. But oh well. </p>\n\n<p>Anywho, what are your thoughts on this DLC? How wrong are my opinions and what are your favorite and least favorite things? </p>\n\n<p>Oh, and I rode the bike from the plateau to Hateno village and fell in love with it on the way lol</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON

We are stuck at  Ta-loh Naeg Shrine and for whatever reasons (despite watching the tutorials on youtube, still unsuccessful at doing any damage) we are unable to defeat/successfully beat the many-legged-robot. We had to stop for the a few months since getting stuck but my kids would love to finish the game. Any way we can skip defeating this thing?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"baaf09ea-1a37-11ea-96a2-0eda228fa741","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2r9f0","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#ab912b","id":"z6owx1","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"aktivate74","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":7,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/botw/comments/z6owx1/im_stuck_at_taloh_naeg_shrine_any_way_i_can_just/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/botw/comments/z6owx1/im_stuck_at_taloh_naeg_shrine_any_way_i_can_just/","subreddit_subscribers":218126,"created_utc":1669616553,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"botw","selftext":"I absolutely hate this part with a tremendous amount angst and rage!
